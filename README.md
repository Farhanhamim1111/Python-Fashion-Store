Hello viewers. 

I am a new coder, and as such, I have decided to work on this simple project that overlaps diffferent aspects of coding, such as dictionaries, functions, loops, if and else statments, etc.

This project was actually intended for a summer internship at a college, but I have decided to post it here to display my early work, and early progress as a programmer. And hopefully, become experienced.
